I’m a self-taught software engineer with a background in cyber security/penetration testing, and have been programming for over 8 years, 
going on 9 now. One of my specialties is reverse engineering. I like to reverse engineer 
various core API’s and technologies in order to 
explore and fabricate new ideas that will make my projects come to life. My favorite video game series known as the MBNS(Megaman Battle 
Network Series) inspired me to want to learn how to code/program.
