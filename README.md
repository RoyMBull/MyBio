# My Bio

   Self-motivated Cyber Security Professional with a background in Software Engineering, IT Technical Support, Security Engineering, and proficiency in Electrical engineering and Reverse Engineering.
   
   I have a love and passion for offensive security. I reverse engineer various core API’s and technologies in order to explore and fabricate new ideas that will make my projects come to life.
   
   I use my Software Engineering skills to design custom exploits and penetration testing tools, and CTF servers that demonstrate my Security Engineering skills and ingenious ingenuity.
   
   My Electrical Engineering skills allow me to devise various custom tools such as keyboard injection exploits that manipulate the virtual keyboard API of a system in order to inject payloads and bypass        security measures for security testing, some with the ability to write their own code, which I use to extend further C/C++ Win32API and LinuxAPI exploits along with python scripts.
   
   On top of being proficient in C/C++ I’m also proficient in 13 programming languages in total, my main ones being: C/C++, Python3, Bash, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, and of course a bit of Powershell scripting      as well.
   
   My IT skills are on par with level 4 tier experience. I use my reverse engineering skills in order to deduce probable causes and solutions for technical problems.
   
   Reverse engineering is my specialty and is how I learn. Given my level of ingenuity, I was allowed to operate above my tier level and demonstrate my skill sets to the fullest and solve lots of complex        technical problems at the companies that I worked at, including the infamous Pfizer Pharmaceutical company, which I have thorough documentation of in my research portfolio.
   
   My skill sets won’t disappoint you! Check out my work and my research. I take pride in what I do as a professional hacker.

   
# Why I'm self taught?

   Due to not being able to afford my education, I had to leave college. However I never let this stop me from pursuing tech and computer programming. 
   I've wanted to be a software    engineer and a penetration tester since I was a child. Programming is my passion and is what I live for. I'm always
   tinkering with new tech and creating new ideas. Programming    has always been a true art I've always felt I could express myself in.

# Why I love Cyber Security?

   Cyber security defines the true art and beauty of computer programming, the art of exploration. Programming to me, is an art, my way of life, and made
   me into who I am today. I would be nothing without it. I love it. Cyber security optimizes and unlocks the full potential of both the programmer 
   and the programming language’s capabilities, and allows for versatility and exploration of many technologies and programming language techniques. 

# My Long Term Goal?

   My long term goal is to secure a red team engineer position as a penetration tester. I am currently going for my CompTIA Security+, CompTIA PenTest+, and
   CEH Certifications. Take a look at what's featured on my main page, as well as my GitHub.

# Additional Information

   I also have a write up from a hacking CTF challenge I participated in from security innovation as part of a job interview. The challenge was really fun, 
   so I decided to type a write up as I went along, explaining my thought process as I went about it. It's an 11 page write up. If you want to see how I 
   critically think, briefly browse around it if you wish to!
