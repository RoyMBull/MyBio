# My Bio

   I’m a self-taught software engineer with a background in cyber security/penetration testing, and have been programming for over 8 years, 
   going on 9 now. One of my specialties is reverse engineering. I like to reverse engineer various core API’s and technologies in order to 
   explore and fabricate new ideas that will make my projects come to life. My favorite video game series known as the MBNS(Megaman Battle 
   Network Series) inspired me to want to learn how to code/program.
   
# Why I'm self taught?

   Due to not being able to afford my education, I had to leave college. However I never let this stop me from pursuing tech and computer programming. 
   I've wanted to be a software    engineer and a penetration tester since I was a child. Programming is my passion and is what I live for. I'm always
   tinkering with new tech and creating new ideas. Programming    has always been a true art I've always felt I could express myself in.

# Why I love Cyber Security?

   Cyber security defines the true art and beauty of computer programming, the art of exploration. Programming to me, is an art, my way of life, and made
   me into who I am today. I would be nothing without it. I love it. Cyber security optimizes and unlocks the full potential of both the programmer 
   and the programming language’s capabilities, and allows for versatility and exploration of many technologies and programming language techniques. 

# My Long Term Goal?

   My long term goal is to secure a red team engineer position as a penetration tester. I am currently going for my CompTIA Security+, CompTIA PenTest+, and
   CEH Certifications. Take a look at what's featured on my main page, as well as my GitHub.

# Additional Information

   I also have a write up from a hacking CTF challenge I participated in from security innovation as part of a job interview. The challenge was really fun, 
   so I decided to type a write up as I went along, explaining my thought process as I went about it. It's an 11 page write up. If you want to see how I 
   critically think, briefly browse around it if you wish to!
